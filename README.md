1. **Sales Trends**:
- Sales peaked in April, indicating a period of strong demand, possibly driven by seasonal factors, promotions, or product launches.
- A sharp decline in sales was observed from May to June, suggesting potential external factors like economic conditions or customer behavior shifts.
Product Popularity:

2. **Product Popularity**:
- T-shirts are the top-selling product category in terms of both total sales and quantity sold, followed by shirts and blazers.
- Medium-sized (M) products have the highest sales and demand, while larger sizes (4XL, 5XL) are the least popular.
Order Status and Cancellations:

3. **Order Status and Cancellations**:
- March had the highest cancellation rate, despite having the lowest order count and sales, which highlights potential issues with product availability or order processing.
- The high number of canceled orders overall indicates potential for improving fulfillment processes and reducing cancellation rates.
Fulfillment and Shipping Preferences:

4. **Fulfillment and Shipping Preferences**:
- Amazon fulfillment accounts for the majority of sales, suggesting that customers trust and prefer faster, reliable fulfillment methods.
- Expedited shipping is preferred by 68.9% of customers, indicating a strong demand for faster delivery options.

## Recommendations

1. **Promotional Strategies**:
   - Launch targeted promotions during peak periods (April) to maintain demand.
   - Investigate the sales drop from May to June and introduce marketing strategies to counteract the trend.

2. **Product Inventory Optimization**:
   - Prioritize stock availability for high-demand products like T-shirts and Medium-sized items.
   - Adjust marketing strategies for less popular sizes to either increase demand or streamline offerings.

3. **Order Fulfillment**:
   - Reduce cancellations by improving inventory management and fulfillment processes, particularly during March.
   - Provide customers with more fulfillment options in areas where Amazon fulfillment is less accessible.

4. **Customer Experience Improvements**:
   - Expand expedited shipping options or provide incentives for standard shipping.
   - Address the causes of order cancellations through better communication and improved order tracking systems.
